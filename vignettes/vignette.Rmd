 ##Introduction
  The mapuloh package is connected with the google geocode API to provide with location and and coordination of the information provided using two main functions: 
  
  
  - address_lookup

To use both functions, it is **required to have the package httr installed** 
  
  ## Functions usage
  
  ###addres_lookup
  
  address_lookup is a function that provides the user with the address of a given a set of coordinates The funtion uses the google geocode API to retrieve the result. The main parameter. 

The only input is **latlong**, a character string that includes the latitude and the longitude.

The function returns a dataframe cointaining Full address names as well as the coordinates:

```{r, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE}
library(boxgooglemap)
head(address_lookup("41.40450 2.17429"), n = 5)
tail(address_lookup("24.83504 118.608"), n = 5)

```


###coord_lookup
The 'coord_lookup' function is a function that provides the user with the coordinates of a given address. The function uses the google geocode API to retrieve the result.

The input needed is **address**, a character string that includes address components.

If the address has partial match, different locations with their full names and  coordinates will be retrieved as a dataframe:
